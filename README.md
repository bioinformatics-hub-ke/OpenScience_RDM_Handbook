# OpenScience_RDM_Handbook
BOSS mini project on Genomic Research Data Management

## Description

Aim:

Create a handbook to facilitate proper research data management in Resource constrained settings. In this project, the participants will be expected to evaluate and compare the various genomics data management approaches that are available and to test how easy it is to set-up and use the tools. The focus is on genomics.

Guide: Use the TuringWay Handbook as a guide on how to create the book. In the Turing-way: Welcome — The Turing Way

Objective: Answer the following questions:

What platforms are available for use in resource constrained settings, especially free or cheap ones
How easy are they to set-up? Here, we are interested in tools that can easily be set up in a lab without very experience system administrators
Explore the role of research data management policies in guiding the implementation of these tools.
