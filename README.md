# OpenScience_RDM_Handbook
BOSS mini project on Genomic Research Data Management

## Description

**Aim:** Create a handbook to facilitate proper research data management in Resource constrained settings. In this project, the participants will be expected to evaluate and compare the various genomics data management approaches that are available and to test how easy it is to set-up and use the tools. The focus is on genomics.

Guide: Use [the TuringWay Handbook](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm.html) as a guide on how to create the book.

## Objective: 
Answer the following questions:
1. What platforms are available for use in resource constrained settings, especially free or cheap ones
2. How easy are they to set-up? Here, we are interested in tools that can easily be set up in a lab without very experience system administrators
3. Explore the role of research data management policies in guiding the implementation of these tools.
